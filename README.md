# Hi, I'm Yang Yi 👋

Hey there!😊

My name is Yang Yi Poh, and I’m a 4th year Electrical and Computer System Engineer studying at Monash University in the beautiful city of Melbourne! 🏙️ 

Here contains some interesting projects that I've worked on the past 3 years. I'm sure there's going to be problems with a lot of them so do let me know how can I improve them.

I'm currently learning C++, so do look forward to some interesting projects in that department. 💖

Have a great day!
